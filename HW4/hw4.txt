1. The instance of graph1 with only 3 colors is not satisfiable
2. The insance of graph1 with 4 colors is satisfiable
3. Since the problem is only solvable with 4 or more colors,
   this tells us that the graph contains a node with degree 4.
   That is, there are four nodes in the graph that need to be 
   colored differently from each other, thus requiring 4 colors.

A solution to the graph coloring problem of graph1 is the following:
(using the colors: red, orange, green, purple)

Node 1: Orange
Node 2: Green
Node 3: Orange
Node 4: Purple
Node 5: Red
Node 6: Green
Node 7: Red

4. This graph problem (graph2.txt) requires at least 8 colors
